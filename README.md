test task

Hello
Task 1 is done in src/test/TestScenario.txt file - written in BDD style


Task2 is done in 2 ways: using API and SELENIUM DRIVER.
you can find in repo src/test/java/ two files, SeleniumTest and ApiTests

For current Task2 test I'd better use API test approuach cause you can easely change size of selected cars list and check their order or sort, using UI you should navigate through pages. Also API test is match faster.
